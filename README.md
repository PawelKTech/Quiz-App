# Quiz App

I created this simple quiz application to test programming knowledge. The app presents multiple-choice questions with radio button answers. Once the user submits their answers, it calculates the number of correct answers and displays the result.

## Features

- I display programming-related questions with multiple-choice answers.
- The user can select one answer per question.
- After answering all the questions, the user will see their score.
- There's an option to retry the quiz after viewing the results.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the app.
- **CSS**: To style the app, add animations, and make it responsive.
- **JavaScript**: To fetch the questions from a JSON file, handle user interactions, and calculate the results.
- **Bootstrap**: For UI components and ensuring responsiveness.
- **Font Awesome & Bootstrap Icons**: For adding icons to enhance the interface.

## How to run
1. Clone or download the project files.
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PawelKTech/Quiz-App
   ```
2. Run the aplication
> **Note:** The application needs to be served from a server (local or remote) to function properly, as it loads external resources like the JSON file. Running it directly from the file system might not work as expected.
